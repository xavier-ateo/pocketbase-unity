## [0.23.5] - 2025-04-29

### Removed

- Task extension methods `ContinueWithOnMainThread` are no longer part of the SDK.

## [0.23.4] - 2025-04-28

### Fixed

- Fixed task continuation not running on WebGL.

### Changed

- Await all tasks instead of using `ContinueWith()`, as this is not supported in Unity WebGL.

## [0.23.3] - 2025-03-16

### Deprecated

- `RecordModel.Created` and `RecordModel.Updated` are now deprecated in favor of `RecordModel.Get<string>("created")` and `RecordModel.Get<string>("updated")` to be more consistent with the Dart SDK.

### Added

- `RecordModel.Get<T>(string, T)` method to extract a single value from the `RecordModel` by a dot-notation path and try to cast it to the specified generic type.
- `RecordModel.GetListValue<T>(string, List<T>)` alias for `Get<List<T>>(string, List<T>)`.
- `RecordModel.GetStringValue(string, string)` alias for `Get<string>(string, string)`.
- `RecordModel.GetBoolValue(string, bool)` alias for `Get<bool>(string, bool)`.
- `RecordModel.GetIntValue(string, int)` alias for `Get<int>(string, int)`.
- `RecordModel.GetFloatValue(string, float)` alias for `Get<float>(string, float)`.

### Changed

- `RecordModel` design to be more consistent with the Dart SDK.
- `RecordModel.Data` is now a `JObject` instead of a `Dictionary<string, JToken>`.

## [0.23.2] - 2025-03-07

### Changed

- `RecordAuth.Record` is now of type `RecordModel` instead of `BaseAuthModel`. You can still access the user data via the `RecordModel[string]` indexer: `auth.Record["name"]`.

### Removed

- Removed `BaseAuthModel`.

## [0.23.1] - 2025-02-06

### Changed

## [0.22.3] - 2025-01-28

### Fixed

- Fixed OAuth2 "all-in-one" flow.

### Changed

### Added

- Add `RecordService.AuthWithOAuth2` method.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-01-23
